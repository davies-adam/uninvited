    - content: You conclude that you must have dozed off while reading. Surely it is past midnight already as it's pretty dark out there, only the moonlight illuminates the room. The candle next to the book is already halfway burned down. You must have slept a while. You look around...

      content: And so it is said that a creature from the Lands of Dreams visits those that have fulfilled their existence's purpose in this world. The Kiivosh takes away the spark of life from the dead with all its memories, intentions, hopes and aspirations. It prepares the deceased for final judgement in the world that lies beyond.
    - content: In the hour of death the Veil of the Kiivosh engulfs the fallen, guarding the deceased until the soul is taken by the creature to its final destiny.
    - content: Some say that once seperated from the body the spirit of the dead might still be experienced in this world until the deeds are judged. Be it as a draft of wind, a whispering out of nowhere or even a serious haunt that offers the dead an opportunity to avenge itself. On the other hand, such things might just be stories of an imaginative mind...
